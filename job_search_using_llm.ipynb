However, there's no explicit mention of experience in visualization or Natural Language Processing (NLP), which are mentioned as desired skills in the job description. We can infer Chris might have some proficiency in visualization due to his varied front-end skills and ability to transform data into insights, but NLP skills aren't even vaguely present. It would be helpful to know if his AI/ML experience included any NLP work. Overall, Chris fits part of the criteria, but not all.\n",
