            "\n",
            "Additionally, they have notable work experience in software engineering roles, which shows they have practical experience working with data structures, algorithms and developing large-scale infrastructure. However, the resume does not clearly specify any experience with Linux Kernel.\n",
            "\n",
            "In terms of programming languages, the candidate is proficient in Java and C++, but there's no mention of Go. Also, it's not clear if they possess experience concerning operating systems internals/administration and networking, as the particular skills or projects in this area are not clearly mentioned on the resume.\n",
            "\n",
            "The candidate does not mention any experience with Kubernetes, which is a preferred qualification. However, they do have strong cloud computing experience and have demonstrated proficiency in using Azure, which could potentially transfer to Google Cloud technologies.\n",
            "\n",
            "In terms of professional experience, the candidate has more than 2 years, indicated by their tenure at Milliman and Cambia Health Solutions. They also have internship experience with Deeplearning.ai, contributing to AI/ML model development, showing they have exposure to AI, a preferred area.\n",
            "\n",
            "The candidate seems to be passionate about AI and software engineering, which aligns with the summary of this Google Cloud's software engineering role. However, the lack of specifics about experience with Linux Kernel, systems programming, virtualization, and Go language is a drawback.\n",
            "\n",
            "In consideration of these factors, I would rate this resume as a 75/100 for this position. The candidate shows promise but would need to learn new skills and tools, as needed by Google Cloud. They may need to flesh out their experiences more, especially concerning the systems programming, Linux Kernel, and containerization knowledge.\n",

            "\n",
            "During my tenure at Milliman, I led the development of scalable backend services using .NET, optimized data pipelines for the efficient processing of large-scale datasets, and ensured the seamless deployment of applications within cloud environments using Azure and Terraform. I also have hands-on experience in operating system internals and administration from my various roles. These experiences gave me the opportunity to interact with diverse teams of engineers as well as clients, ensuring efficient operations and the delivery of top-tier software solutions. \n",
            "\n",
            "My preferred qualifications include proficiency with Kubernetes, a deep understanding of low-level systems programming, virtualization concepts, and expertise in building infrastructure with test-driven development. I deeply appreciate the comprehensive value of serverless computing and have had the opportunity to work on Google Cloud delivering containerized workloads during my internship at Deeplearning.ai. \n",
            "\n",
            "Google Cloud's commitment to pushing technology forward and its focus on innovation strongly resonate with my professional ethos. I look forward to the opportunity to contribute to the Serverless team, particularly on the Serverless Sapphire project, drawing from my extensive experience with container and file systems.\n",
